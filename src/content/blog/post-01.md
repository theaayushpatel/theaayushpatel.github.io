Modern web `development` frameworks have transformed how we build applications. Let's look at the evolution of these tools and where they're headed next.

The philosophy of programming languages offers insights into how we think about problems and their solutions. This post examines different programming paradigms.

The intersection of mathematics and computer science produces some of the most elegant solutions to complex problems. This post explores that relationship.

```python
def show_menu():
    print("\n== To-Do List Menu ==")
    print("1. View tasks")
    print("2. Add task")
    print("3. Remove task")
    print("4. Exit")

def main():
    tasks = []
    while True:
        show_menu()
        choice = input("Choose an option (1-4): ")
        if choice == '1':
            if not tasks:
                print("No tasks yet!")
            else:
                for idx, task in enumerate(tasks, start=1):
                    print(f"{idx}. {task}")
        elif choice == '2':
            task = input("Enter the task: ")
            tasks.append(task)
            print("Task added!")
        elif choice == '3':
            task_num = int(input("Enter task number to remove: "))
            if 0 < task_num <= len(tasks):
                removed = tasks.pop(task_num - 1)
                print(f"Removed: {removed}")
            else:
                print("Invalid task number!")
        elif choice == '4':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
